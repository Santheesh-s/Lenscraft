<p>A ground level shot is when your camera’s height is on ground level with your subject. <br>This camera angle is used a lot to feature a character walking without revealing their face,<br> but it can help to make the viewer more active and use the actor's performance to build an idea. </p>
<p>A dramatized version of the knee level shot, a ground level shot is a camera angle that involves placing the camera at its lowest possible level, that is, the ground. One of the most rare camera angles, ground level shots can be a great way to build tension and catch the audiences’ attention. Owing to its ballet setting, Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 thriller Black Swan has some of the most memorable ground level shots in film history.</p>
<p>How to use it:  You can use ground-level shots to make your character introductions more aesthetic, for instance, by showing them walking in the space, without revealing their face. But if you’re not making a film, you can still use ground-level shots as b-roll for dance videos and tutorial videos, as well as in fashion videos to showcase footwear. </p>
